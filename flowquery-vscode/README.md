# FlowQuery for VSCode

Run FlowQuery statements from within VSCode.

### Howto?
1. Open a .cql file and press shift+enter.
2. Query results show up in a separate tab.

You can create a .env (key=value pairs) file in the same directory as your .cql files and refer to variables defined in the .env file from cql files, for example '$key'.
